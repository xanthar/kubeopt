Evaluate if tasks should be delegated to subagents for context optimization.

Run:
```bash
claude-harness orchestrate evaluate
```

If delegation is recommended, generate the queue:
```bash
claude-harness orchestrate queue
```

Show me which subtasks can be delegated and the estimated token savings.
